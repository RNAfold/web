# About
We are developing next generation AI-powered drugs targeting the 75% of the human genome that is transcribed into RNA molecules that are not translated into proteins.
These non-coding RNAs are a diverse class of RNA fulfilling a plethora of functions in the cell and contributing to various diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative diseases.
Tens of thousands of these potential new therapeutic targets are hidden in the dark genome.
We build a generative AI system that leverages large-scale therapeutically informative RNA data to predict future generations of therapeutics targeting the dark genome.
