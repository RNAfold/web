# About
We develop AI algorithms to make better RNA therapeutics faster.

We address the significant challenge of developing RNA-targeting drugs. It is a process hindered by the complex folding of RNAs and unknown binding partners. Current methods rely on trial and error, screening thousands of compounds with limited predictive success, often leading to failures in later stages due to toxicity or lack of efficacy.
We leverage cutting-edge multimodal AI algorithms to predict RNA-targeting drugs with high accuracy. By training on comprehensive structural data of target RNAs and potential drug compounds, including binding experiments and toxicity profiles, our AI models can efficiently identify promising drug leads.
We generated unique training datasets resulting in an AI platform that predicts successful drugs with at least 100x better accuracy. Currently in the preclinical stage, we aim to revolutionise RNA therapeutics by enhancing discovery, design, and development processes.
